   Once the note has been created, the user can hit the save icon located in the upper right hand corner of the nav bar and their note is saved to the left-hand column. Upon clikcing a created note in the left-hand column, the user is presented with the text from the saved note. Each note contains a delete icon (the trash can symbol located to the right of each note), that, when clicked, removes the note from the queue.
